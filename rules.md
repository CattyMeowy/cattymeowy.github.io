# Hello, and welcome to the Discord server!
You're probably pretty pumped about being here. Before you start chatting though, make sure to read these rules first!

# - Profanity -

**1. This server is strict on profanity use.**

Use this command in any channel to be DMed a list of unacceptable words: !bannedwords

  `1a. Do not bait, even if its a joke.`
    
Baiting is when people type a usually non-offensive word that contains letters at the beginning/end from known offensive words, then mark the other contents of the word other than the beginning/end as a spoiler, example: if tomato was a bad word, t//opat//o

  `1b. Do not try loopholes.`
    
Loopholing is when people try to bypass the rules by typing different variations of bad words, example: if potato was a bad word, potayto

<details open>
<summary>For example, you may not:</summary>
<br>
- Use any derogatory slurs (including ethical, racial or disability slurs)
  
- Use profanity to insult people
  
- Use profanity over the PG-13 level (F words are not allowed)
  
- Use banned profanity with loophole tricks (e.g. spelling it a different way or using a different font)
  
</details>

# - Common sense -

**2. Do not make jokes about controversial subjects (e.g. murders referenced in graphic detail, suicides, real world disasters, disturbing events), sexual content, political figures and dark humor unless it's justified by reasonable context.**

Some of our members are sensitive to these subjects. Please do not make it sound funny unless there is reasonable context behind the joke.

   `2a. Joking about people in the server lightheartedly or people IRL (including me) is allowed if it is friendly, not very offensive and not like teasing.`
    
Saying mean or malicious messages behind one's back is enough to get you banned.

   `2b. Do not spam or make text walls.`
    
Copypastas are allowed as long as they do not violate any of the rules and they are not too long.

   `2c. Do not get into heated discussions and come to a conclusion when necessary.`
    
Light debates are OK, but getting into a full-on argument with another member is unacceptable and can make people feel uncomfortable.
<details open>
<summary>For example, you may not:</summary>
<br>
-  Talk about serious topics in detail
  
-  Make fun of controversial events such as 9/11
  
-  Talk about serious topics in general if there is no context behind it (e.g. explaining a serious topic is fine if it isn't detailed, referencing or relating a serious topic to a meme or something funny isn't)
  
</details>

# - Identity -

**3. Be yourself and respect everyone's decisions and identity.**

It's OK to have different opinions and to have different likes and dislikes. Most importantly, no matter what race you are, your sexuality or what cultures you are in, we will accept you for who you are.

   `3a. Do not make jokes about sexuality and/or race.`
   
This includes making jokes about gay people.

   `3b. If someone has different likes and dislikes and you feel like you want to contradict them, prevent yourself from doing so.`
   
Remember - its ok to be different!

   `3c. Do not make fun of people affiliated with different cultures.`
   
Sure, they could sound wrong to you but it really isn't. Everyone deserves to be respected and feel welcome. No one should shame or feel shamed of someone's/your hobbies and interests. 

<details open>
<summary>For example, you may not:</summary>
<br>
-  Post antisocial messages that are likely to offend people
  
-  Post anti-furry, anti-weeb, anti-LGBTQ+ or anti-culture messages
  
-  Post messages deemed as morally wrong (e.g. pedophile jokes, satanic group talk)

# - Promo -

**4. Self promotion is allowed, but there are conditions.**

You are only allowed to self promo in #chat if:
- You are currently streaming
- You are sharing a video you made
- You are not begging for followers or subscribers
You are also allowed to promote servers and things in your bio, but self-promoting in people's DMs is not okay. If you have a malicious link in your bio we will jail you.

   `4a. You cannot post Discord server invite links in the server.`
   
We understand you would like to grow your server and invite more people, but this server is not the place to send invite links.

   `4b. You can only post links from YouTube, Twitch, Vimeo, Tracker.GG, Tenor, Discord Media and gaming platforms such as Xbox and PS Network.`
   
Any other links will be deleted.

   `4c. Posting links from TikTok will result in a kick.`

Due to the controversial nature of TikTok, we will immediately kick people sending links related to the platform.

-  Promote your TikTok channel with links instead of videos
  
</details>

  `9a. Do not post media from a game or a movie that is rated R18+ or higher.`

  `9b. Do not post media from a game or a movie that is banned from Australia.`
  
If you feel what you're about to post may be controversial, check at https://classification.gov.au and check the "Include adult and Refused Classification material" box. If the content you would like to post is rated X18+ or RC, please do not post it.

Quips and voice lines containing F word+ profanity are allowed if it is during gameplay and not during a cutscene.

**11. Don't post media with illegal substance depictions unless used in a reasonable context.**

  `11a. Drug depictions from games are excluded.`
  
Games depicting drugs or drug references without actual drug use is allowed. If a game contains hard drug use, please do not post media related to it.
