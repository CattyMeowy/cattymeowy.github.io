# Hello, and welcome to the Discord server!
You're probably pretty pumped about being here. Before you start chatting though, make sure to read these rules first!

# - Profanity -

**1. This server is strict on profanity use.**

Use this command in any channel to be DMed a list of unacceptable words: !bannedwords

  `1a. Do not bait, even if its a joke.`
    
Baiting is when people type a usually non-offensive word that contains letters at the beginning/end from known offensive words, then mark the other contents of the word other than the beginning/end as a spoiler, example: if tomato was a bad word, t//opat//o

  `1b. Do not try loopholes.`
    
Loopholing is when people try to bypass the rules by typing different variations of bad words, example: if potato was a bad word, potayto

<details open>
<summary>For example, you may not:</summary>
<br>

  - Use any derogatory slurs (including ethical, racial or disability slurs)
  
- Use profanity to insult people
  
- Use profanity over the PG-13 level (F words are not allowed)
  
- Use banned profanity with loophole tricks (e.g. spelling it a different way or using a different font)
  
</details>

# - Common sense -

**2. Do not make jokes about controversial subjects (e.g. murders referenced in graphic detail, suicides, real world disasters, disturbing events), sexual content, political figures and dark humor unless it's justified by reasonable context.**

Some of our members are sensitive to these subjects. Please do not make it sound funny unless there is reasonable context behind the joke.

   `2a. Joking about people in the server lightheartedly or people IRL (including me) is allowed if it is friendly, not very offensive and not like teasing.`
    
Saying mean or malicious messages behind one's back is enough to get you banned.

   `2b. Do not spam or make text walls.`
    
Copypastas are allowed as long as they do not violate any of the rules and they are not too long.

   `2c. Do not get into heated discussions and come to a conclusion when necessary.`
    
Light debates are OK, but getting into a full-on argument with another member is unacceptable and can make people feel uncomfortable.
<details open>
<summary>For example, you may not:</summary>
<br>
-  Talk about serious topics in detail
  
-  Make fun of controversial events such as 9/11
  
-  Talk about serious topics in general if there is no context behind it (e.g. explaining a serious topic is fine if it isn't detailed, referencing or relating a serious topic to a meme or something funny isn't)
  
</details>

# - Identity -

**3. Be yourself and respect everyone's decisions and identity.**

It's OK to have different opinions and to have different likes and dislikes. Most importantly, no matter what race you are, your sexuality or what cultures you are in, we will accept you for who you are.

   `3a. Do not make jokes about sexuality and/or race.`
   
This includes making jokes about gay people.

   `3b. If someone has different likes and dislikes and you feel like you want to contradict them, prevent yourself from doing so.`
   
Remember - its ok to be different!

   `3c. Do not make fun of people affiliated with different cultures.`
   
Sure, they could sound wrong to you but it really isn't. Everyone deserves to be respected and feel welcome. No one should shame or feel shamed of someone's/your hobbies and interests. 

<details open>
<summary>For example, you may not:</summary>
<br>
-  Post antisocial messages that are likely to offend people
  
-  Post anti-furry, anti-weeb, anti-LGBTQ+ or anti-culture messages
  
-  Post messages deemed as morally wrong (e.g. pedophile jokes, satanic group talk)
  
</details>

# - Promo -

**4. Self promotion is allowed, but there are conditions.**

You are only allowed to self promo in #chat if:
- You are currently streaming
- You are sharing a video you made
- You are not begging for followers or subscribers
You are also allowed to promote servers and things in your bio, but self-promoting in people's DMs is not okay. If you have a malicious link in your bio we will jail you.

   `4a. You cannot post Discord server invite links in the server.`
   
We understand you would like to grow your server and invite more people, but this server is not the place to send invite links.

   `4b. You can only post links from YouTube, Twitch, Vimeo, Tracker.GG, Tenor, Discord Media and gaming platforms such as Xbox and PS Network.`
   
Any other links will be deleted.

   `4c. Posting links from TikTok will result in a kick.`

Due to the controversial nature of TikTok, we will immediately kick people sending links related to the platform.
<details open>
<summary>For example, you may not:</summary>
<br>
-  Promote your content aggressively (e.g. asking people to like and subscribe and spamming your content across different channels)
  
-  Promote Discord servers in voice channels
  
-  Promote your TikTok channel with links instead of videos
  
</details>

# - Privacy and other rules -

**5. Mods and admins reserve the right to kick/ban you if they feel you are doing something wrong.**

If the mod or admin was abusing their power they will be immediately demoted and/or banned/kicked.

   `5a. Do not ping members of the server unless they are actively engaged in the chat.`

Please do not annoy our members who have nothing to do with the current state of the chat.

**6. Please respect out members' privacy.**

Please don't leak information or dox members in our server.

  `6a. Don't negatively comment on peoples' statuses.`
  

<details open>
<summary>For example, you may not:</summary>
<br>
-  Attempt to ping @everyone or @here in the server
  
-  Use ghost ping exploits
  
-  Leak personal information such as IP addresses, emails or names
  
</details>

**7. Profanity is allowed in your bio as long as your custom status doesn't contain any.**
   
Spotify statuses are excluded. People found with an offensive custom status will be jailed until they change it.



# - Media -

**8. Do not post sexually suggestive or explicit media.**

Media designed to sexually arouse the viewer is not allowed here.

  `8a. Media containing naturalistic nudity is allowed within an educational context.`

Media that is non-sexual but contains nudity is fine if it has context (e.g. body painting, traditional native cultures).

  `8b. Artistic nudity is allowed if it is historical only.`
  
Images of naked statues or historical artworks are allowed. Users are not allowed to post OC content containing nudity.

**9. Do not post extremely violent or otherwise objectionable content.**

Please don't post real life death or game clips focused on blood or gore.

  `9a. Do not post media from a game or a movie that is rated R18+ or higher (with some exceptions).`

You may check content ratings at https://classification.gov.au. Despite what country you live in, this Discord server is Australian, so the Australian rating system is used. Here are games that are exceptions to this rule:


 - GTA V (depictions of the strip club, cutscenes with swearing (background swearing is allowed) or drug use are not allowed)
 - Mortal Kombat (since violence as a whole is unrealistic and exaggerated)
 - Doom and Doom Eternal (since gore is briefly depicted and fades away)
 - Call of Duty: WWII and Call of Duty: Black Ops III (BO3 robot death scene is not allowed)
 - Anything that only has the consumer advice "References to sexual violence" or with a T rating in America
 - Memes related to, but not containing gameplay from, R18+ games


  `9b. Do not post media from a game or a movie that is banned from Australia.`
  
If you feel what you're about to post may be controversial, check at https://classification.gov.au and check the "Include adult and Refused Classification material" box. If the content you would like to post is rated X18+ or RC, please do not post it.

  `9c. Do not post media from a game or a movie focusing on sexual material or sexualized nudity.`
  
Please do not post offensive sexual references or allusions and nudity without reasonable context.

  `9d. Do not post content intended to disturb or scare the viewer.`
  
This is pretty self-explanatory; some members are sensitive to disturbing content. Basically don't post anything that would give the average 13 year old nightmares.  Examples include, but are not limited to, jumpscares, disturbing horror imagery, body horror, creepypastas, etc.

**10. Please don't loophole profanity using media clips.**

Attempting to post clips with F word+ profanity may result in a jail.

  `10a. General profanity from games are excluded.`
  
Quips and voice lines containing F word+ profanity are allowed if it is during gameplay and not during a cutscene.

**11. Don't post media with illegal substance depictions unless used in a reasonable context.**

Title is self explanatory; just generally posting illegal substances is not allowed unless you have context behind it. Methods on how to use or make illegal substances are not allowed, even if they are fake.

  `11a. Drug depictions from games are excluded.`
  
Games depicting drugs or drug references without actual drug use is allowed. If a game contains hard drug use, please do not post media related to it.

**12. Depictions of gambling are not allowed unless there is reasonable context.**

Please do not post media containing gambling without context.

<details open>
<summary>For example, you may not:</summary>
<br>
-  Share a video about a game gore demonstration
  
-  Post media or art containing suggestive material
  
-  Post a video containing extended or clear sequences of F word+ profanity
  
</details>

`*Jailbans are suspensions that don't let you access any channels until the ban period is over but you will still be in the server. If you leave the server during a jailban you will be instantly banned.`

# FAQ

**I've seen someone violating the rules. All the moderators are offline. What do I do?**

Members who have the Cats role have permission to access the *emergency-mod* channel, which temporarily grants them the Emergency Mod role, which gives them Moderator perms for an hour. This allows them to delete messages, disconnect members from voice channels and kick offenders. The Emergency Mod role can only be acquired once every year to prevent abuse. If you don't have the Cats role, ping a member with the Cats role and ask them to take action.

**I want to post something, but I'm not sure if it doesn't violate the rules. What should I do?**

DM Catty if he is available with what you'd like to post. You will not get banned for sending questionable content for evaluation; however, if the content is found to be severe, you may receive a short jailban.

**There is a moderator abusing their powers. Catty is offline - what should I do?**

While this is unlikely, this can still happen, especially with members who have activated Emergency Mod. Moderators cannot ban members, so if you get kicked, just rejoin. Catty will take action once he wakes up from his sleep.

**If you have any questions, just ask Catty!**
