# Hello, and welcome to the Discord server!
You're probably pretty pumped about being here. Before you start chatting though, make sure to read these rules first!

#- Profanity -

**1. This server is strict on profanity use.**
Use this command in any channel to be DMed a list of unacceptable words: !bannedwords
    1.a Do not bait, even if its a joke.
Baiting is when people type a usually non-offensive word that contains letters at the beginning/end from known offensive words, then mark the other contents of the word other than the beginning/end as a spoiler.
    1.b Do not try loopholes.
- Common sense -
2. Do not make jokes about controversial subjects, sexual content, political figures and dark humor unless it's justified by context.
Some of our members are sensitive to these subjects. Please do not make it sound funny unless there is reasonable context behind the joke.
    2.a Joking about people in the server lightheartedly or people IRL (including me) is allowed if it is friendly and not like teasing. 
Saying mean things or malicious messages behind one's back is enough to get you banned.
    2.b Do not spam or make text walls.
Copypastas are allowed as long as they do not violate any of the rules and they are not too long.
- Identity -
3. Be yourself and respect everyone's decisions and identity.
It's OK to have different opinions and to have different likes and dislikes. Most importantly, no matter what race you are, your sexuality or what cultures you are in, we will accept you for who you are.
   3a. Do not make jokes about sexuality and/or race.
This includes making jokes about gay people.
    3b. If someone has different likes and dislikes and you feel like you want to contradict them, prevent yourself from doing so.
Remember - its ok to be different!
    3c. Do not tease/insult furries, weebs, other fandoms and people who identify as LGBTQ+.
Sure, they might sound wrong to you but it really isn't. Everyone deserves to be respected and feel welcome. No one should shame or feel shamed of someone's/your hobbies and interests.
